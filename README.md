# Unsupervised-Learning---Clustering-Algorithms
Clustering Algorithms used: K-Means, DBSCAN and	Hierarchical 

Scenario
You work at a local jewelry store. You’ve recently been promoted and the store owner asked you to better understand your customers. Using some sneaky magic (and the help of Environics!), you’ve managed to collect some useful features for a subset of your customers: age, income, spending score, and savings (i.e., how much savings they have in their bank account). Use these features to segment your customers and create customer personas.
